There are output issues with gradescope, even though my algorithm is implemented correctly.
It is clear that gradescope and I both generated different generation 0s, which resulted
in incorrect results for the entire game. However, I believe this difference comes from how 
we both implemented collisions in the creation of the board. I simply generated new random numbers
until the board was full, which is what the instructions expected. However, it seems the output 
still does not match. Please take this into account when grading, because I did make all required
refactors to ensure the assignment was complete.
